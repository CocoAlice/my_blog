                    <p>
                        I am reciting this poem again. It was my favorite since maybe high school. It is possibly the third time of my reciting it. It is a pity that now I can't really feel the passion and that gentle finger causing the ripples in my heart when I first read it. I can only try to imagine what it was feeling like as like trying to remember a blur dream or rubbing over an almost recovered scar.
                        </br>
                        But I will recite it and remember it well. It is like a name of my long-lost friend that I try very hard not to bring up during a long quiet night. It is like a sent in the wind reminding you a place, a snowy day, and someone who was between a friend and a lover. It is like a piece of music you will always carry with you in your MP3, but you won't ever choose to play it, at least not on a random sunny day... ... With all of them, I buried shreds of my past. They will be my unique treasure and I will enjoy them with the little fox from The Little Prince sitting beside the waves of the golden field.

                            He gives his beloved certain rhymes
                        </strong>
                        </br>
                        Fasten your hair with a golden pin,
                        </br>
                        And bind up every wandering tress;
                        </br>
                        I bade my heart build these poor rhymes:
                        </br>
                        It worked at them, day out, day in,
                        </br>
                        Building a sorrowful loveliness
                        </br>
                        Out of the battles of old times.
                        </br>
                        You need but lift a pearl-pale hand,
                        </br>
                        And bind up your long hair and sigh;
                        </br>
                        And all men's hearts must burn and beat;
                        </br>
                        And candle-like foam on the dim sand,
                        </br>
                        And stars climbing the dew-dropping sky,
                        </br>
                        Live but to light your passing feet.
